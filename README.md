## About The Game

WebGL Puzzle Dungeon is a 2D maze-puzzle game built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the WebGL API for rendering. Players navigate through procedurally generated dungeons, collect all the coins, and find the exit to advance to the next level. The game features multiple difficulty settings, unlockable characters, and a retro pixel-art aesthetic.

## How to Play
